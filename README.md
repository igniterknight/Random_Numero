# Random_Numero
It's a small Project based on guessing game. 
- a list is generated with 500 elements in it randomly appended using random module.
- Type down a number ranging from 1 to 1000 as randint was set to 1 to 1000 to return values randomly.
- run the code to check whether you've got the element in the list.
